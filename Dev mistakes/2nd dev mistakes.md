# Lesser-Known Security Vulnerabilities: A Bug Hunter's Guide

> **Key Statistics:**
> - Critical/High severity issues make up 80% of analyzed patterns [[computation]]
> - Caching and Third-Party Dependencies show highest average priority scores (11.0/12.0) [[computation]]
> - 60% of vulnerabilities have Medium detection difficulty [[computation]]

## Top Priority Vulnerabilities by Category

### 1. Integration & Configuration Issues

| Category | Mistake | Real-world Example | How Attackers Exploit | Missed By Devs Because | Tool/Test |
|----------|---------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| API Misuse | GraphQL Introspection Exposure | HackerOne reports of schema exposure | Send introspection queries to enumerate API structure | Enabled for development convenience | GraphQL Introspection Query Tool |
| Caching Errors | Cache Poisoning via Headers | Major CDN providers affected | Manipulate HTTP headers to poison cache keys | Complex caching behavior understanding | Burp Suite Cache Poisoning Scanner |
| CI/CD Security | Pipeline Poisoning | SolarWinds supply chain attack | Compromise build scripts and configurations | Insufficient pipeline security controls | Pipeline Security Scanners |

### 2. Third-Party Dependencies & SDK Issues

| Category | Mistake | Real-world Example | How Attackers Exploit | Missed By Devs Because | Tool/Test |
|----------|---------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Dependency Management | Dependency Confusion | Microsoft, Apple, Tesla affected (2021) | Upload malicious packages with internal names | Lack of private registry usage | Dependency Confusion Scanner |
| Feature Management | Feature Flag Injection | Production features exposed | Manipulate client-side feature flags | Insufficient server-side validation | Feature Flag Testing Tools |

### 3. Cloud Service Misconfigurations

| Category | Mistake | Real-world Example | How Attackers Exploit | Missed By Devs Because | Tool/Test |
|----------|---------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Cloud IAM | Overly Permissive Roles | Cloud IAM misconfiguration | Exploit excessive permissions | Default configurations used | CloudSploit, ScoutSuite |
| Resource Access | Unprotected Resources | Public S3 bucket exposures | Direct access to unsecured resources | Convenience over security | S3Scanner, CloudMapper |

## Testing Methodology for Bug Hunters

### High-Priority Targets (Priority Score > 10.0)

1. **Cache Poisoning (Score: 11.0)**
   - Testing Method: Manipulate cache keys through HTTP headers
   - Tools: Param Miner, Cache Poisoning Scanner
   - Focus Areas: CDN configurations, caching headers

2. **Dependency Confusion (Score: 11.0)**
   - Testing Method: Check internal package names in public repos
   - Tools: Dependency Confusion Scanner
   - Focus Areas: Package.json, requirements.txt files

3. **GraphQL Introspection (Score: 10.5)**
   - Testing Method: Send introspection queries to endpoints
   - Tools: GraphQL Voyager, InQL Scanner
   - Focus Areas: Development endpoints, API documentation

### Medium-Priority Targets (Priority Score 7.0-9.5)

1. **CI/CD Pipeline Security (Score: 9.5)**
   - Testing Method: Review pipeline configurations
   - Tools: GitLab Security Scanner, Jenkins Security Scanner
   - Focus Areas: Build scripts, environment variables

2. **Feature Flag Management (Score: 7.0)**
   - Testing Method: Test feature flag bypass techniques
   - Tools: Feature Flag Testing Suite
   - Focus Areas: Client-side controls, configuration endpoints

## Root Cause Analysis

| Root Cause | Frequency | Impact | Why Developers Miss It |
|------------|-----------|---------|----------------------|
| Integration Issues | High | Critical | Complex system interactions |
| Configuration Errors | High | High | Default settings trusted |
| Dependency Management | Medium | Critical | Insufficient vetting |
| Feature Management | Medium | Medium | Client-side trust |

## Recommendations

### For Developers
1. Implement strict validation for all external inputs
2. Use private package registries for internal dependencies
3. Implement server-side feature flag validation
4. Regular security audits of CI/CD pipelines

### For Bug Hunters
1. Focus on high-impact, medium-difficulty vulnerabilities first
2. Build custom tools for testing specific vulnerability patterns
3. Understand complex system interactions
4. Monitor public vulnerability disclosures for new patterns

> **Strategic Testing Priority:**
> Focus on vulnerabilities with high severity (Critical/High) and medium detection difficulty, as these offer the best balance of impact and discovery potential [[computation]].
