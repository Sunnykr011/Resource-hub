Based on the research reports, I'll provide a comprehensive solution for your portable hacker environment restoration system.

# ðŸŒ‘ ShadowVault - Cross-Distro Environment Restoration System

## 1. Recommended Cloud Service: Mega
After analyzing various cloud providers, Mega stands out as the best choice for your use case because:
- It offers 20GB of free storage (highest among free providers)
- Has robust CLI support through MEGAcmd for automation
- Provides API access for potential future integrations
- Works well on Live USB environments due to its lightweight client

## 2. System Architecture

## 3. Restoration Script (shadowvault.sh)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Colors for output
RED='\033[0;31m'
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
BLUE='\033[0;34m'
NC='\033[0m'

# Configuration
VAULT_MOUNT="$HOME/ShadowVault"
MEGA_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
MEGA_PASS="your-password"

echo -e "${BLUE}[*] Initializing ShadowVault...${NC}"

# Check for MEGAcmd
if ! command -v mega-login &> /dev/null; then
    echo -e "${RED}[!] MEGAcmd not found. Installing...${NC}"
    # Add installation commands based on distro
    if [ -f /etc/debian_version ]; then
        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y megacmd
    elif [ -f /etc/arch-release ]; then
        yay -S megacmd
    fi
fi

# Login to Mega
echo -e "${BLUE}[*] Authenticating with Mega...${NC}"
mega-login $MEGA_EMAIL $MEGA_PASS

# Create mount point and mount Mega
echo -e "${BLUE}[*] Mounting ShadowVault...${NC}"
mkdir -p $VAULT_MOUNT
mega-mount $VAULT_MOUNT

# Create necessary directories
echo -e "${BLUE}[*] Creating local directories...${NC}"
mkdir -p ~/.config
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin

# Symlink directories
echo -e "${BLUE}[*] Creating symlinks...${NC}"
ln -sf $VAULT_MOUNT/tools ~/tools
ln -sf $VAULT_MOUNT/notes ~/notes
ln -sf $VAULT_MOUNT/payloads ~/payloads
ln -sf $VAULT_MOUNT/bin/* ~/.local/bin/

# Restore configurations
echo -e "${BLUE}[*] Restoring configurations...${NC}"
for config in $VAULT_MOUNT/dotfiles/.*; do
    if [ -f "$config" ]; then
        ln -sf "$config" ~/$(basename "$config")
    fi
done

# Restore .config directory
for config in $VAULT_MOUNT/.config/*; do
    if [ -d "$config" ]; then
        ln -sf "$config" ~/.config/$(basename "$config")
    fi
done

# Reload shell configuration
echo -e "${BLUE}[*] Reloading shell configuration...${NC}"
source ~/.bashrc 2>/dev/null || source ~/.zshrc 2>/dev/null

echo -e "${GREEN}[+] ShadowVault restoration complete!${NC}"
```

## 4. Security Considerations

To enhance security, you should:
- Use encryption for sensitive files using tools like `gpg` before uploading
- Store credentials in an encrypted format or use environment variables
- Implement checksums for critical files to verify integrity

## 5. Bundling for Redeployment

To create a portable package:
```bash
# Create an encrypted archive
tar -czf - ShadowVault | gpg -c > shadowvault_backup.tar.gz.gpg

# To extract later
gpg -d shadowvault_backup.tar.gz.gpg | tar xz
```

## 6. Additional Features

### Automatic Backup Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Add to crontab for regular backups
rsync -avz --delete ~/ShadowVault/ mega:/ShadowVault/
```

### Version Control Integration
You can also version control your dotfiles using tools like:
- GNU Stow for managing symlinks
- chezmoi for handling machine-specific configurations

## 7. Usage Instructions

1. Download the script:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/shadowvault/main/shadowvault.sh
```

2. Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x shadowvault.sh
```

3. Configure your Mega credentials:
```bash
export MEGA_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
export MEGA_PASS="your-password"
```

4. Run the restoration:
```bash
./shadowvault.sh
```

This solution provides a robust, secure, and portable way to maintain your hacking environment across different Linux distributions, even in Live USB environments. The system is designed to be minimal, CLI-first, and easily customizable to your specific needs.
